*Github:*

Git means "version control tool"
- being able to jump to different checkpoint.
- allow multiple version at one checkpoint to be edited by different users.

Creating projects on Github:
Repository name use CamelCase

Think Repository as a book
README.md as a Forward
everything_else.md as a Chapter

In terminal:
mkdir - to create folder
touch - to create file
git init - creates a space where github will be initialzied
atom . - means to open all into atom
git add whatever.md - add the files onto stage before saving into Github
git status - tells you the stage where the file you placed aka the changes you have done
git commit -m "kjshdfs" - to save to computer to be pushed to github "-m" allows us to note messages about the save
git remote add - where to add the files add a name to refer to the address and add the website address
git push origin master - pushes the file of "origin" aka address name to the "master"
