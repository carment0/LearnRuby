*Github:*

Git means "version control tool"
- being able to jump to different checkpoint.
- allow multiple version at one checkpoint to be edited by different users.

Creating projects on Github:
Repository name use CamelCase

Think Repository as a book
README.md as a Forward
everything_else.md as a Chapter

In terminal:
mkdir - to create folder
touch - to create file
git init - creates a space where github will be initialized 
atom . - means to open all into atom
